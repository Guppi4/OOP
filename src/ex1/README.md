This project deals with weighted graph

the project contains 2 classes and 3 interfaces and 2 tests 

DataStructure:
the data structure of  weighted undirected  graph, can add nodes, delete nodes, connect nodes, get a specific node/edge,
for nodes in graph i used a data structer "HashMap "(time complexety of add and get its O(1)) anf for neghbors in node used "Hashset"
The edge weights are contained in the HashMap
algorithms:
shortestPathDist,shortestPath-used algoritm of Dijkstra(time compexety is O(E+VlogV))
(The isconnected function is used algoritm of BFS)
